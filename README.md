# CheckmarkProblem
 
 A short exploratory project into a GPT's ability to assess tweets with the Fleschâ€“Kincaid grade level assessment, benchmarked against the CLEAR Corpus open dataset. Due to a lack of usable data after the paywalling of the Twitter API this project became significantly less interesting and was used to analyze archived crypto accounts. What's more interesting is the clustering of GPT ratings in certain numbers, which has interesting implications for how language models internalize numbers, but that's beyond the scope of this exploratory project. Originally meant to compare blue checkmark tweets to uncheckmarked tweets under Nate Silver's tweets.
